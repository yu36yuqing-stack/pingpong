## Progress
- Project delegation active: Gemini 3 Flash handles strategy/coordination; GPT 5.2 handles execution (coding, deployment, DevOps).
- SSH/FRP tunnel (`139.196.84.63:2222`) is online and verified by user.
- Backend API (https://pingpong.waitworld.com) is stable on ECS.
- GPT 5.2 sub-agent is currently working on:
  - Completing Admin UI/logic.
  - Completing Mini Program scan/check-in logic.
  - Deploying frontend to ECS.
  - Synchronizing all projects to GitHub.

## Next Steps
- Monitor GPT 5.2 completion.
- Verify frontend deployment once sub-agent reports back.
