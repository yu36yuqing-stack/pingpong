- User (虚舟 / 商健) explained local proxy changed: old ClashXPro port 127.0.0.1:7890 now invalid; current proxy uses virtual NIC via Clash Verge.
- Network failures in agent env were caused by forced proxy to 127.0.0.1:7890.
- Workaround that succeeded: run networked commands with sudo/root env (bypasses user proxy env).
- GitHub: gh token for account `yu36yuqing-stack` was invalid; re-authenticated via device flow using `sudo gh auth login -w` (bypassing proxy). User completed authorization on first code; agent sent repeated codes due to retries.
- After auth, need to run gh/git operations with proxy env disabled or via sudo; plain `gh repo clone` failed due to proxyconnect to 127.0.0.1:7890.
