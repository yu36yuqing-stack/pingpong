- Deployed pingpong backend to ECS (139.196.84.63) with systemd + nginx reverse proxy.
- User preference/rule (strong): If there is an obviously “better” default action (e.g., using HTTPS instead of asking), Jarvis should **execute the best option directly** and then report results; avoid asking confirmation for improvements unless there’s risk/cost/irreversibility.
- Context mgmt rule (strong): keep rolling context under ~50k tokens; if near/over (~200KB or ~1500 lines), compress before doing further work.
